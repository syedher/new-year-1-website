Hey... I know we are not perfect or anything like that... I know
we make mistakes, I know we hurt each other. I know we feel like shit sometimes because of that...
I know that you feel bad because of me or because I felt bad coz of you. I'm just saying...
if we are together next year too... then we'll encounter countless fights, some even go as far as breaking up.
But, remember why we stayed through all that, why we are doing all this and what we'll get after all this, 
it's just that It'll be good if we stay together and remember our plans during this time...
I know it'll be hard but let's stay and face it together... It's not You Vs Me or anything like that...
Just remember that you're loved and we need to stay the next year too to make our plans a success.
For Haider... we'll stay together next year too.
<br><br>

And if we’re not—  
I hope you remember that you were loved sincerely.
